Learning project to implement a rotation animation on a sphere.
Written in C, uses Windows for windowing, Opengl for graphics
/////////////////////////////////////////
Some code is adapted or taken from the Opengl ES 2.0 programming guide.  
Mainly shader.cpp, though AAContext and AAWindow are adaptations of files originally targetting the ES environment.
Hence the naming similarity perhaps.

It is a windows only application.  I will work to adapt it into a multi-platform application, as another project.
For setting up the project, visual studio would be helpful.
You also need FreeImage and glew libraries, to work with the source code.
